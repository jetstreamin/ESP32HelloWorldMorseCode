Today was a day of firsts for me as a developer. I had always been intimidated by the idea of writing code for specific hardware, but I was inspired by the FlipperZero to build my own hacking tools from various microcontrollers. I decided to take the plunge and try my hand at creating my first IoT "hello world" app for an ESP32 WROOM NODEMCU-32S development board.

The ESP32 WROOM NODEMCU-32S development board is a powerful and versatile platform for IoT development. It features a dual-core processor, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a wide range of input/output options. The chip at the heart of the development board is the ESP32, which is known for its low power consumption and high performance.

One of the key features of the ESP32 is its support for a range of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, MQTT, and WebSockets. This makes it easy to connect the development board to the internet and communicate with other devices. The ESP32 also has built-in support for various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and motion, which makes it ideal for applications that require data collection and analysis.

There are many possible applications for the ESP32 WROOM NODEMCU-32S development board. It can be used to create smart home devices, such as thermostats and security systems, as well as industrial and agricultural applications. It can also be used to build custom IoT solutions for a wide range of industries, such as healthcare, transportation, and retail.

To get started with the ESP32 WROOM NODEMCU-32S development board, I installed Visual Studio Code and Platform.IO. Setting up my development environment with these tools was much easier than I had expected. Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor that has a wide range of features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging. Platform.IO is an open source ecosystem for IoT development that enables developers to build, test, and upload their code to a variety of microcontrollers.

Once I had my development environment set up, I turned to the internet for guidance on how to create my first IoT app. I found a highly informative video by Tomasz Tarnowski that walked me through the process step-by-step. In addition to the video, I also used ChatGPT as a resource to help me understand the concepts and techniques involved in IoT development.

The process of creating my first IoT app was a learning experience, but it was also an adventure. I enjoyed the challenge of working with new technologies and figuring out how to make them work together. It was satisfying to see my code come to life on the ESP32 and to see the "hello world" message appear on the screen.

I am confident that my knowledge and skills in IoT will be valuable assets in my career, as I believe that IoT maintenance and design is going to become an increasingly important skill with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. The ability to gather field data and harvest it to the cloud in order to make real-time business decisions is at the heart of IoT, and I am excited to be a part of that revolution.

I am also excited to continue learning and growing as an IoT developer. There is always more to learn and new technologies to explore, and I am eager to dive in and see what the future holds. Whether I am creating tools for defensive security measures or developing applications that help businesses make more informed decisions, I am excited to see where my skills in IoT will take me.
